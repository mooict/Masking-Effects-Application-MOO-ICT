# C# OOP Project– Create Masking Effects Animation in Windows Forms and Visual Studio

Hi, in this tutorial we will explore how to make masking effect animation using windows form and C# programming. This tutorial will be created fully using only visual studio. We will not be using any other framework or libraries creating this project. The template we will use for this project is the Windows Forms Application in Visual Studio using C# and .Net. To create this project and follow this tutorial step by step, please download the images below the video section below. The masking effect is created using 2 of the same image. 1 of those image has been darkened and converted to black and white. The other image is still in full colour. We will apply the first background to the form and the second one will be used for the circles generated dynamically on the screen. Both image will hold their aspect ratio when loaded in the program so it will be as if we have created a masking effect in the application. We will be moving the circles independently from each other by using OOP programming principle.
